# Notation3 Editor in JavaScript

You can find an online demo here: [http://ppr.cs.dal.ca:3002/n3/editor](http://ppr.cs.dal.ca:3002/n3/editor)

## Description

Using the [latest Notation3 grammar](https://github.com/w3c/N3/blob/master/grammar/README.md), 
I generated a JS lexer, parser and listener using the ANTLR tool support. 
See [here](https://github.com/w3c/N3/blob/master/grammar/README.md#creating-the-js-parser) for more information on how to generate the JS parser.

I then used the JS parsing code to flag errors for a [CodeMirror lint-enabled editor](https://codemirror.net/demo/lint.html). 
For syntax highlighting, I re-used the [Turtle mode](https://codemirror.net/mode/turtle/index.html),
extending it with Notation3 keywords. 

The editor has a neat "show AST" function that will print the AST generated by the JS parsing code.

In lieu of a JavaScript Notation3 reasoner, 
I created [a simple server](https://github.com/william-vw/n3-editor-js/blob/master/app.js)
that is called by the editor whenever "execute" is clicked. The server will execute the given formula using 
either the [Eye](https://github.com/josd/eye) or [Cwm](https://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html) system. 
It can easily be configured with additional systems, when they become available.

## Installation

This system requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Clone the repository and run `npm install` in the main folder to install the NodeJs packages.

Add a config file under `./config/main.js` similar to the ones already there (.e.g, `./config/local.js`)

Update the `./editor/index.html` file with the URL of the NodeJs server. If you're following the regular usage, this should simply be the editor's URL minus the `editor` part (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:3002/n3` for `http://127.0.0.1:3002/n3/editor`.

If you want to use the server's "link-shortening" service (to more easily share code samples; see usage), you'll need to have a mysql v.8+ database running, with the credentials filled into `./config/[file].js`. Also, you'll have to import the `db.sql` file. If you don't want to use this service, you can simply comment out the call to `n3.link` (see `editor/index.html`) and use the full url (`link` variable) for the generated link.

Run `./node app.js` to start the server. 
The server will be accessible at `http://<hostname>:<port>/n3`, and the editor at `http://<hostname>:<port>/n3/editor`. 

If you're using localhost and port 3002, you will find the server at [http://127.0.0.1:3002/n3](http://127.0.0.1:3002/n3), and the editor at [http://127.0.0.1:3002/n3/editor](http://127.0.0.1:3002/n3/editor).

## Development

After editing anything inside `editor/` folder (aside from the `lib/` folder), run `npx webpack` ([requires webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/)) to generate `dist\main.js\`. You'll see that `index.html` directly references `dist\main.js\` as well as the files from the `lib/` folder.

**Important**: `n3Parser.js` requires a manual edit to make `symbolicNames` available outside of the module. Below `var symbolicNames ..` add `n3Parser.symbolicNames = symbolicNames;`.

**Notes**:
- You can turn off minimization in `webpack.config.js`. Enabling it will drastically reduce the size of `main.js` but also make it much harder to debug.


## Usage

You can use shortcuts "alt-x" and "alt-a" to execute the current formula or show its AST, respectively.

You can generate links to share examples of N3 code ("create link to formula"). Currently, this requires URL-encoding the N3 formula, which can lead to very long URLs. Hence, the server is outfitted with a simple "link-shortening" service (a la bit.ly) that will generata a unique 8-letter ID for the generated URL. 

This service simply translates the URL-with-ID to the full URL-with-encoded-formula; meaning that the size of the formula will still be limited by the max. length of a URL (around 2000 characters). The service stores each ID with its corresponding full URL in a mysql database together with the timestamp.

E.g. (copy URL in address bar):

_Pass a formula and print its AST_:  
http://</span>ppr.cs.dal.ca:3002/n3/editor/?formula=:i :am :cool .&ast=true


_Pass a formula and get its deductive closure from Cwm_:  
http://</span>ppr.cs.dal.ca:3002/n3/editor/?formula=:i :is :cool . :you :know :i . { :you :know ?a . ?a :is :cool } => { :you :is :cool } .&exec=eye
