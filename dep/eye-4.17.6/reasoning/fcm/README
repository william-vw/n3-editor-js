Fuzzy Cognitive Maps
--------------------

Fuzzy cognitive maps use directed graphs to represent knowledge and the
fuzzy set theory to give variables a membership between zero and one
instead of only the values zero and one. On top of that it allows us to
denote the relation between two variables with a correlation coefficient.
Decisions are made by using an iterative algorithm.
